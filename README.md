# My Projects Devlog
This is the place where I reason and try to explain my way into solving problems in my projects.  

I usually forgot why do I do thing is certain way, or maybe comments are not enough. This is why this site come in handy. Devlog also useful if somebody wants to tag along and understand my code on demand.  

> This devlog is a substitute for my [journal](http://jurnal-dennis.herokuapp.com), which currently under development.
