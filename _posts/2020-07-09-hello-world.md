title: Hello World!
---

First of all, I'm kind of screwed up. I sent my laptop for a screen replacement for a dead pixel. The problem is, I only backup my college data and I don't have any substitute PC to work on except my dad's computer that's running on AMD Phenom II with 2GB of RAM. I have no choice.  

I can't do stuff in the way I used to, but I can work this out by myself. Another problem I need to solve is setting up workspace so I can work on my project again. For some reason some of my tools aren't working and I have to bodge things around.  

My [journal](htpp://jurnal-dennis.herokuapp.com) is one of the things that can't properly run on this PC. I want to rebuild the journal anyway so I make this blog as the substitute for my journal.  

I'm also working on several open source project, will update later!  

See you on next post ~
